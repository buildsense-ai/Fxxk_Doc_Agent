            "content": "The project is located at No. 1, Alley 2, Jixiang Street, Hebian-She, Baiyun District, Guangzhou. The original building, known as the Zhiqing Building, was a two-story brick-concrete structure used as a community elderly activity center. Over the years, the building has developed severe structural issues, including extensive wall cracks that exceed safety standards, posing significant safety hazards. Inspections revealed that the load-bearing structure has become brittle, making it susceptible to collapse from minor vibrations or external impacts. The building is adjacent to the Yiling Ancient Temple, a protected cultural relic, with a minimum distance of 6 meters between them. To ensure the safety of the temple and prevent irreversible damage from a potential collapse, the community decided to initiate a reinforcement project. The plan involves upgrading the building into a multifunctional complex, including a cultural activity center, elderly service center, and community childcare institution, while creating a safety buffer zone for the temple."

            "title": "Project Overview",
            "content": "The proposed project involves constructing a community cultural activity center. The building will feature an open garden at the front and a main building with a cast-in-place reinforced concrete frame-shear wall structure at the back. The building will have a width of 19.7 meters and a total depth of 22 meters, including the garden. The main building will cover an area of 125.9 square meters, with the garden occupying 65 square meters, resulting in a total construction area of 473.6 square meters. The building will be two stories high, with a height strictly controlled at 8.8 meters. It is classified as a second-class multi-story residential building with a seismic fortification intensity of 7 degrees. The exterior load-bearing parts will use reinforced concrete columns, and the infill walls will be made of 200mm thick ordinary concrete hollow blocks. The main wall surface will be covered with three-color 45x90 ceramic exterior wall tiles, with deep gray 45x90 ceramic tiles used for all horizontal and vertical window frames. The exterior wall skirt will have a height of 300mm, also using deep gray 45x90 ceramic tiles, and the second-floor roof will feature corrugated ceramic tile eaves. The construction will take place within the original Zhiqing Building's footprint, maintaining its relationship with the surrounding buildings."

            "content": "The original Zhiqing Building has been demolished due to safety hazards. The site is now leveled, surrounded by residential buildings on the west and south sides, with heights generally not exceeding 24 meters. A retaining wall is present at the site edge, with a 1.6-meter gap from the adjacent cultural relic unit. The north side is bordered by a narrow alley, approximately 3 to 3.5 meters wide, narrowing inward. The west side has a higher terrain, with the ground elevation reaching the height of the second floor, surrounded by residential buildings with heights generally within 24 meters. The south side features a narrow alley."

            "content": "The Yiling Ancient Temple is located in Baiyun District, Guangzhou, built in 1724 during the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, with several reconstructions over the years. It features a five-room, two-courtyard layout with a double-slope hard mountain roof and dragon boat ridge. The temple houses various deities and is a site of active worship, with significant historical and cultural value for studying local beliefs. The temple is well-preserved and serves as a cultural landmark in the area."
