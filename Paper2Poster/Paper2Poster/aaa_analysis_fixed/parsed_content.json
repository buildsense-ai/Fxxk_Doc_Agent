            "content": "The project is located at No. 1, Alley 2, Jixiang Street, She, Baiyun District, Guangzhou. The original building, known as the Zhiqing Building, was a two-story brick-concrete structure that served as a community elder activity center. Over the years, it has developed severe structural issues, including extensive wall cracks that exceed safety standards, posing significant safety risks. The load-bearing structure has become brittle, making it susceptible to collapse from minor vibrations or impacts. Importantly, the building is adjacent to the Yiling Ancient Temple, a registered cultural relic protection unit, with a minimum distance of 6 meters between them. To ensure the safety of the cultural relic and prevent irreversible damage from a potential collapse, the community has decided to initiate a reinforcement project. The plan is to upgrade the building into a multifunctional complex that includes a cultural and sports activity center, an elder service center, and a community childcare institution, providing modern public service space while creating a safety buffer zone for the cultural relic."

            "title": "Project Overview",
            "content": "The proposed project involves constructing a community cultural and sports activity center. The front of the building will feature an open garden, while the main building will be a cast-in-place reinforced concrete frame-shear wall structure. The building will have a width of 19.7 meters and a total depth of 22 meters, including the garden. The main building will cover an area of 125.9 square meters, with the garden occupying 65 square meters, resulting in a total construction area of 473.6 square meters. The building will be two stories high, with a height strictly controlled at 8.8 meters. It is classified as a second-class multi-story residential building with a seismic fortification intensity of 7 degrees. The exterior walls will be supported by reinforced concrete columns, with 200mm thick ordinary concrete hollow blocks used as infill material. The main wall surface will be covered with three-color 45x90 ceramic exterior wall tiles, and all horizontal and vertical window frames will use dark gray 45x90 ceramic tiles. The exterior wall skirt will be 300mm high, also using dark gray 45x90 ceramic tiles, and the second-floor roof will feature corrugated ceramic tiles. The construction will take place within the original Zhiqing Building's footprint, maintaining its relationship with the surrounding buildings."

            "content": "The original Zhiqing Building has been demolished due to severe safety hazards. The site is now leveled, surrounded by residential buildings on the west and south sides, with heights generally not exceeding 24 meters. A retaining wall is present at the site edge, with a distance of 1.6 meters from the adjacent cultural relic unit. The north side is also surrounded by residential buildings, with a narrow alley approximately 3 to 3.5 meters wide gradually narrowing inward. The west side has a higher terrain, with the ground elevation reaching the height of the second floor, surrounded by residential buildings with heights generally within 24 meters. The south side features a narrow alley."

            "content": "The Yiling Ancient Temple is located in Helong Street, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. It was originally built in the 20th year of the Yongzheng period (1724) and underwent several reconstructions during the Qianlong and Daoguang periods, as well as in 1999. The temple faces southeast and features a five-room, two-courtyard layout with three courtyards, measuring 16.9 meters wide and 19.8 meters deep. It has a double-slope hard mountain roof with dragon boat ridges, an internal beam frame with ancient-style beams, and a blue brick wall with stone feet and brick floors. The temple houses statues of the Emperor Yiling, Marshal Kang, and Guanyin, with side halls containing altars and statues. The temple has been well-preserved and holds historical and cultural value for studying local beliefs."
