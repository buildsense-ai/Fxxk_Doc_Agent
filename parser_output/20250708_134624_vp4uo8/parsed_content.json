            "content": "The project is located at No. 1, Lane 2, Jixiang Street, She, Hebian, Baiyun District, Guangzhou. The original building, known as the Zhiqing Building, was a two-story brick-concrete structure that served as an activity center for the elderly. Over forty years of exposure to the elements have caused significant structural damage, including extensive wall cracks that exceed safety standards, posing serious safety risks. Inspections revealed brittle load-bearing structures, making the building susceptible to collapse from minor vibrations or impacts. The building is adjacent to the Yiling Ancient Temple, a protected cultural relic, with a minimum distance of 6 meters between them. To ensure the safety of the temple and prevent irreversible damage from a potential collapse, the local economic society decided to initiate a reinforcement project. The plan is to upgrade the building into a multifunctional complex that includes a cultural and sports activity center, a comprehensive service center for the elderly, and a community childcare institution. This will provide modern public service space while creating a buffer zone to protect the cultural relics."

            "title": "Project Overview",
            "content": "The proposed project involves constructing a cultural and sports activity center. The front of the building will feature an open garden, while the main building will be a cast-in-place reinforced concrete frame-shear wall structure. The building will have a width of 19.7 meters and a total depth of 22 meters, including the garden. The main building will occupy an area of 125.9 square meters, with the garden covering 65 square meters, resulting in a total construction area of 473.6 square meters. The building will be two stories high, with a height strictly controlled at 8.8 meters. It is classified as a second-class multi-story residential building with a seismic fortification intensity of 7 degrees. The exterior walls will be supported by reinforced concrete columns, with 200mm thick ordinary concrete hollow blocks used as infill material. The main wall surfaces will be covered with three-color 45x90 ceramic exterior wall tiles, and all horizontal and vertical window frames will use dark gray 45x90 ceramic tiles. The exterior wall skirt will be 300mm high, also using dark gray 45x90 ceramic tiles, and the second-floor roof will feature corrugated ceramic tile eaves. The construction will take place within the original Zhiqing Building's footprint, maintaining its relationship with the surrounding buildings."

            "content": "The original Zhiqing Building has been demolished due to safety hazards. The site is now leveled, surrounded by residential buildings on the west and south sides, with heights generally not exceeding 24 meters. The site features a retaining wall along the edge, with a distance of 1.6 meters from the adjacent cultural relic unit. The north side is bordered by a narrow alley, approximately 3 to 3.5 meters wide, which narrows inward. The west side has a higher terrain, with the ground elevation reaching the height of the second floor of surrounding buildings. The south side is bordered by a narrow alley."

            "content": "The Yiling Ancient Temple is located in Heliang Street, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. It was originally built in the 20th year of the Yongzheng era (1724) and underwent several reconstructions during the Qianlong, Daoguang, and Xuantong periods, with the latest renovation in 1999. The temple faces southeast, featuring a five-room, two-entry, three-courtyard layout. It has a width of 16.9 meters and a depth of 19.8 meters, with a double-slope hard mountain roof and dragon boat ridge. The interior includes ancient beam structures and blue brick walls with stone bases. The main and rear halls house statues of the Yiling Emperor, Princess Kang, and Guanyin, while the side halls contain altars and statues. The temple is well-preserved and holds historical and cultural value for studying local beliefs."
